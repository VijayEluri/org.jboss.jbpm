/**
 * TODO: implement new permissions management mechanism, something like:
 * have a properties based permission concept (for various values), and each permission would be of certain type (as it is of interface now),
 * and have the handler for each type available (which checks for permission satisfy).
 * Or even have an aspect, which would check each method, which is done with permission needed 
 * (permission, or permissions are being passed to the method params).
 * Would be like "do something with satisfying permission - throws exception if doesn't"
