/**
 * This class is intended to be implemented by specific managers (either view or process, for now) creators.
 * Those would be registered to BMPFactory(Impl) and therefore be known to it, when requested.
 * The idea behind this is, that for each process definition, there might be specific behavior managers.
 * E.g. manager for cases (CasesBpmViewManager or CasesBpmProcessManager).
